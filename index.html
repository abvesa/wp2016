                      <h3>thE thiNG thAt ENLiGhtENEd ME</h3>
                        <p>SO lets get things real quick. I love <a class = "underline">Sketching</a> and <a class = "underline">Graphic Design</a>, or other things that's beautiful, abstract, blur
                             or simple just because they're myterious, that always gives me huge ammount of inspiration to live and pursuing my dream.<br \><br \></p>

                               <h3>COMES tO PURSUiNG MY dREAM</h3>
                                 <p>CURRENTLY my dream is to <a class = "underline">design/develop Tabletop games or card games</a>. Actually I like logic stuffs too. I can spend day and nights figuring out 
                                      those mechanics and rules, just wanna find whats the winning condition in that game. It's very lucky to tell you all that I'm <a class = "underline">running a project</a> 
                                         which is about <a class = "underline">card game</a> just now, with two of my best highschool friends. I do those drawings, one work on the rules and another responsible for 
                                           public relations. We're still a very tiny group now: Meanwhile, the game is still beta testing and developing, but I always have a dream to make an <a class = "underline">WEB version</a> 
                                             of this game, and thats the prime reason for me to come here to learn.</p>
